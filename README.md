CTP Hacks 2024 Hackathon project.

## Setup instructions

#### Libraries to install
* Flask
```
pip3 install Flask
```
* NPM
```
npm install
```
* PyMongo
```
pip3 install PyMongo
```

## Running the code

To run backend from `CTP-Hackathon/`, type:
```
cd backend
python3 main.py
```
To run frontend from `CTP-Hackathon/`, in a separate terminal, type:
```
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## How the code works

The `backend` folder provides the backend for the **Crucial Circle** program, including the backend Python file `main.py`. The `frontend` folder provides the frontend using REACTJS and Vite.
